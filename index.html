    <h3>ok here's what i need. only display two path divs at a time, with location at the end of each. so i have a path and location pair. hide the rest. add/remove with display: hidden. run animate function passing in the path/location div id so miles left calculates on those widths. have distance traveled based on # of oxen. when distance left is within location range trigger that. after leaving SHOP hide prior div and show the one following current. ACTUALLY, maybe just show ONE path/location at a time. have dummy path at end going from location to edge of screen. maybe i don't need positions, i just need to shrink the path size with each spacebar press (and eventually movement is automated). when movement is automated though i'll need some sort of check at the start of movement function to see if key pressed. actually not too hard.</h3>
